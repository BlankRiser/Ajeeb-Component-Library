# Ajeeb

React component library built using TailwindCSS, CVA and the foundations of Ajeeb design system

## Objective

Ajeeb is a React component library built using TailwindCSS, CVA and the foundations of Ajeeb design system. It is a collection of components that can be used to build a website or an application. It is a work in progress and will be updated as and when required.

The plan is to basically build a component library like tailwind UI so that one can just copy the code and use it in their project. I also plan to build each component with [Radix Prmitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and also with [headless UI](https://headlessui.com/).

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
